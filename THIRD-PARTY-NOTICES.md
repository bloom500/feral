# Third-party notices

Cinderpaw is licensed under BUSL-1.1 (see `LICENSE`). This file records third-party
work Cinderpaw builds on, and the notices that work requires.

It covers two things: designs we derived from, and source we copied into this
tree. Package-manager dependencies are not listed here. Those ship with their
own licenses and are resolved at install time; this file is for work that would
otherwise look like ours.

## Prime Agent / pi — the notebook design

**Used in:** `CinderpawAgent/src/rlm/`

Cinderpaw's persistent notebook (`src/rlm/repl.ts`) and the doctrine the model is
given about it (`src/rlm/prompt.ts`) are derived from the **RLM (Recursive
Language Model)** design in Prime Agent, specifically `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompts/rlm.ts`
and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/rlm-runtime.ts`, read at commit `965941c`.

- Prime Agent: https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent
- Upstream framework (`pi-mono`): https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono
- RLM concept: https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/rlm

**What is derived:** the idea of giving an agent a long-lived interpreter rather
than a one-tool-per-turn loop, and the structure of the doctrine that makes it
work — bind results to variables, do not treat the interpreter as the native
environment of the system under study, be explicit about which state survives
between cells.

**What is not:** no source file is copied. Their interpreter is IPython, driven
over a Python kernel; ours is a `node:vm` JavaScript context, because the
sidecar already runs on Bun. The Python-specific doctrine (`%%bash` cells,
`%cd`, `os.environ`, pre-imported skill modules, subshell state warnings) has no
analogue here and was rewritten rather than translated. Recursive subagent
spawning (`rlm()`) is not implemented.

The upstream work is MIT licensed. Its notice follows in full.

## OpenClaw - tool-call repair scanner

**Copied verbatim into:** `CinderpawAgent/src/vendor/tool-call-repair/grammar.ts`,
`CinderpawAgent/src/vendor/tool-call-repair/payload.ts`

- **Source:** https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
  (`packages/tool-call-repair/src/`)
- **License:** MIT, full text in
  `CinderpawAgent/src/vendor/tool-call-repair/LICENSE`
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 OpenClaw Foundation
- **Modifications:** one import specifier changed from `./grammar.js` to
  `./grammar.ts` to match our module resolver. Otherwise verbatim.

Used to recover tool calls emitted in formats other than the one we ask models
for. See `CinderpawAgent/src/vendor/tool-call-repair/README.md` for what it
covers, what it does not, and why the rest of that package was left behind.
