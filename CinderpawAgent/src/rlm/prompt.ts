 * The notebook doctrine — what the model is told about its interpreter.

 * Ported from Prime Agent's `prompts/rlm.ts` (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Mario
 * Zechner; see ../../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). The *structure* of the doctrine is
 * theirs and it is the part worth keeping: state the interpreter is long-lived,
 * insist results get bound to variables, warn against treating the notebook as
 * the native environment of the thing under investigation, and spell out which
 * state survives between cells and which does not.
 *
 * Everything Python-specific is rewritten rather than translated, because a
 * literal translation would be wrong: their `%%bash` cells, `%cd`, `os.environ`
 * and pre-imported skill modules describe IPython, and our notebook is a
 * `node:vm` JavaScript context. Their subshell warning has no analogue here —
 * we have no shell magic, and shell work goes through the `shell_exec` tool
 * like any other capability.
