/**
 * Persistent JS notebook — Cinderpaw's answer to Prime Agent's IPython kernel.
 *
 * The idea is Prime Intellect's RLM (Recursive Language Model): give the model
 * a long-lived interpreter instead of a one-tool-per-turn loop, so it can bind
 * results to variables, write helper functions, and compose tool calls as
 * program logic. See ../../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.
 *
 * Their kernel is IPython because their stack is Python. Ours is JavaScript
 * because the sidecar already runs on Bun, so the interpreter is free and
 * in-process — no `uv`, no Python, no zeromq, and the sidecar keeps its zero
 * runtime dependencies and its single-binary build.
 *
 * ── The one rule this file exists to keep ──────────────────────────────────
 * `ToolRegistry` is the choke point where the egress proxy, the audit log and
 * the process sandbox are applied: "a tool can never be invoked outside the
 * sandbox and can never exercise an undeclared permission" (registry.ts).
 * A naive `eval` would hand the model ambient `fetch`, `Bun`, `process` and
 * `require`, i.e. every permission at once, and the sandbox would be over.
 *
 * So the code runs in a `node:vm` context whose globals are ONLY what we put
 * there: a curated set of pure builtins plus one async function per registered
 * tool, each of which is a thin wrapper over `registry.call()`. Every tool call
 * from the notebook is audited and permission-checked exactly like a call from
 * the normal agent loop.
 *
 * Removing globals is not enough on its own. `node:vm` is not a security
 * boundary out of the box: every host object reachable from the context leaks
 * host `Function` via `.constructor.constructor`, and `Function("return
 * process")()` compiles in *our* realm — unaudited filesystem and network, past
 * every gate above. During development that escape worked from `this`, from an
 * object literal, from an injected builtin, from a tool wrapper, and from a
 * tool's return value. All of them are closed by severing prototypes (see
 * `severed`) and by injecting no host builtins at all, and each route has a
 * regression test. Those tests are load-bearing: if one starts passing values
 * back out, the sandbox is void.
 *
 * The honest residual: this hardens `vm`, it does not turn it into a jail
 * against an adversary who controls the source. The threat model is a model
 * writing clumsy or careless code, and Cinderpaw already exposes `shell-exec`
 * through the same registry, so the notebook widens no permission that was not
 * already reachable. If Cinderpaw ever runs code from an untrusted third party
 * here, this needs a real isolate, not prototype surgery.
 *
 * ponytail: no per-tool codegen, no TS transpile step — tools are injected as
 * real function objects. Add a compile step only if the model starts needing
 * type hints inside the notebook.
