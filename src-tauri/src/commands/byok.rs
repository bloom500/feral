    //
    // The old code loaded ALL providers into memory (populating api_key from
    // the keychain for every one of them), updated just the one the UI edited,
    // then called `save(&settings)` — which iterates every provider and
    // re-writes its keychain entry. On macOS (Cinderpaw isn't Apple-notarized
    // yet, see README) each keychain write can prompt for the login password;
    // if the user dismisses the prompt for ANY provider — including ones they
    // never touched in this edit — the whole call fails with a generic
    // keychain error. This is what the "Save Failed on OpenRouter / NVIDIA
    // NIM" report (Darius, 2026-08-22) actually was: the user was editing one
    // row, but the save touched the OS keychain for every previously-saved
    // provider, and one prompt got dismissed.
    //
    // `save_provider` only writes THIS provider's keychain entry (when the
    // api_key field is non-empty) and updates just its row in byok.json. The
    // rest of the keychain is untouched — no unrelated prompts, no unrelated
    // failures. `save_provider` reads the on-disk metadata directly, so we
    // no longer need `State<AppState>` here (removed from the arg list; the
    // other read/remove/test commands in this file already had no state).
    //
    // An enabled provider needs a key. Saving one with an empty key stored a
    // configuration that looks complete in the UI and fails on the first
    // request with an authentication error from the vendor — which reads as
    // "my key is wrong" rather than "there is no key". Whitespace counts as
    // empty: a pasted key with a stray newline is the common way this happens.
    //
    // "Empty" means empty EVERYWHERE, not just in this request. The key field
    // in the UI is never pre-filled with the stored secret, so someone who
    // opens an already-configured provider to change only its model or base
    // URL sends an empty api_key with enabled=true. Rejecting that was the
    // "Save Failed on OpenRouter / NVIDIA NIM" report (Darius, 2026-08-22):
    // the providers that failed were exactly the ones already set up. An
    // empty key here means "leave the stored one alone" — `save_provider`
    // already skips the keychain write in that case.
    let api_key = api_key.trim().to_string();
    // ...unless the provider has no key to give. This table also stores the
    // chosen VOICE for a speech engine, and Piper's voice is a local file:
    // picking `ro_RO-mihai-medium` and pressing Save arrived here as
    // `enabled: true, api_key: ""` and was answered with "cannot be enabled
    // without an API key" — about an engine that runs on the machine and has
