      {/* The window's drag handle, once, for every page there is and every page
          there will be.
          Each page used to bring its own strip, which meant each page could
          forget — and two had: Connectors and Extensions could not be dragged at
          all, and Chat lost its handle entirely while the agent onboarding was
          on screen, because the header that carried it was not rendered. A
          frameless window that cannot be moved is not a small bug.

          Deliberately placed after `main` and given no z-index: both are
          positioned, so DOM order puts this above the page content and it
          receives the drag. Everything that must stay clickable already sits
          higher — the sidebar at z-30 (its collapse button lives in this band),
          the call overlay at z-100 with a strip of its own, and the window
          controls at z-200.

          Only the element carrying the attribute drags, so a button that ends up
          under this band is still a button: Tauri looks at the event target, not
          at the ancestors. */}

          full-screen overlays and modals. Window chrome is the one layer a page
          must never be able to cover.

          Portalled to <body>, and raising the z-index is why that is necessary
          rather than tidy. This band lives inside `.app-pane`, which has a
          `backdrop-filter`, and inside `#root`, which sets `z-index: 1`. Both
          open a stacking context, so `z-[200]` here is 200 WITHIN a layer whose
          own value is 1 — and the call overlay is portalled to <body> at z-40,
          outside all of it. 40 beats 1, whatever the number inside says. The
          controls were raised from z-40 to z-200 once already to fix exactly
          this, and could not have worked: the comparison was never between 200
          and 40. Leaving the context is the only thing that does. */}

          state, like the toasts below it, and the sidebar it used to live in

          the bottom-right, colliding with the chat composer, the other in the
          corner beneath it. They now stack together where the eye already goes.
          pointer-events-none so the empty column never swallows clicks meant
          for the page; each card re-enables them. */}
      {/* Portalled for the same reason as the controls above: z-[200] inside
          `#root`'s z-index-1 stacking context lost to the call overlay's z-40
